# Problem 1

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop; and remove the day variable.

``` r
pols <- 
  read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%  #read pols-month data
  separate(mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month", "day")) %>% # y/m/d variables
  mutate_at(c("year", "month", "day"), as.numeric) %>% # convert to numeric
  mutate(month = month.abb[month], # jan-dec
         president = case_when(prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop", prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")) %>% # combine into president
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))
```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp <- 
  read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, sep = "/", into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>%  # m/d/y variables
  mutate_at(c("year", "month", "day"), as.numeric) %>% # convert to numeric
  mutate(month = month.abb[month]) %>% # jan-dec
  select(-day) %>% # remove day
  relocate(year, month)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
unemployment <- 
  read.csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "month", cols = Jan:Dec) %>% # switch to long format
  rename(year = Year) # match format
```

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
merge1 <- left_join(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
merge2 <- left_join(merge1, unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

``` r
dim(merge2)
```

    ## [1] 822  11

``` r
names(merge2)
```

    ##  [1] "year"      "month"     "gov_gop"   "sen_gop"   "rep_gop"   "gov_dem"  
    ##  [7] "sen_dem"   "rep_dem"   "president" "close"     "value"

``` r
min(merge2$year)
```

    ## [1] 1947

``` r
max(merge2$year)
```

    ## [1] 2015

The resulting dataset contains 11 columns and 822 observations,
containing data from 1947 to 2015. Some key varibles include: part of
current president, number of GOP senators, number of Democratic
senators, among others.

# Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

- specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
  with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
  read_excel
- use reasonable variable names
- omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data

The data include a column for the (approximate) number of homes powered.
This calculation is described in the Homes powered note, but not applied
to every row in the dataset. Update the data to include a new
homes_powered variable based on this calculation.

- Homes Powered - Each ton of trash equates to on average 500 kilowatts
  of electricity. An average household will use 30 kilowatts per day.

``` r
mr_trash <- read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date),
         homes_powered = `Weight (tons)`*(500/30),
         trash_type = "Mr Trash") %>%
  select(-c(`Homes Powered*`, 15:16))
```

    ## New names:

Use a similar process to import, clean, and organize the data for
Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda, and combine these with the Mr. Trash
Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset. To keep track of which
Trash Wheel is which, you may need to add an additional variable to all
datasets before combining.

``` r
# Professor Trash
prof_trash <- read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date),
         homes_powered = `Weight (tons)`*(500/30),
         trash_type = "Prof Trash",
         `Sports Balls` = NA) %>%
  relocate(`Sports Balls`, .before = "homes_powered") %>%
  select(-`Homes Powered*`)

# Gwynda Trash
gwynda_trash <- read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 4) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date),
         homes_powered = `Weight (tons)`*(500/30),
         trash_type = "Gwynda Trash",
         `Sports Balls` = NA,
         `Glass Bottles` = NA) %>%
  relocate(`Glass Bottles`, .after = `Cigarette Butts`) %>%
  relocate(`Sports Balls`, .after = `Wrappers`) %>%
  select(-`Homes Powered*`)

# Bind Rows Together
trash_all <- rbind(mr_trash, prof_trash, gwynda_trash) %>% 
    arrange(Dumpster, Date)
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in the resulting dataset, and
give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel? What was the total
number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021?

My final dataset contains 845 observations. There are multiple records
per Dumpster, collected on different days by Mr. Trash, Prof. Trash, or
Gwynda Trash. There is information about the volume of trash collected,
weight of trash collected, type of trash collected, and more. The total
weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is.

``` r
# total weight of trash collected by Prof trash wheel
trash_all %>%
  filter(trash_type == "Prof Trash") %>%
  summarize(total_weight = sum(`Weight (tons)`))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   total_weight
    ##          <dbl>
    ## 1         216.

``` r
# total cig by Gwynda July 2021
```
